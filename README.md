# The Monkees - By Juliet Gardener

**First Milestone Project: User Centric Front End Development  - Code Institute**

This is a front-end only website I have designed for a 1960's rock band called The Monkees. The website has specifically been designed for the use of the bands fans and potential
fans to see and hear clips from their past and recent material as it becomes available. It has also been designed to promote their music and publicise their availability for 
event bookings for fans around the world.

## Demo

A live demo can be found [here](https://julietisstudent.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/).

## UX

My goal in the design of the website was to stick to a black and white base color, as the use of the bands videos and photos would be full of color, and therefore did not want
to overload the color user interface.
My goal was to also create a site that was easy accessible for fans to navigate around with the requirements provided by the bands representatives.

## Technologies

* HTML5
    * The structure for site
* CSS 
    * The style format for the site
* Bootstrap (v3.3.7)
     * Framework for responsive design
* jQuery 
     * To Simplify Document Object Model manipulation
* JavaScript
     * To create interactive design

## Features

The site features bootstraps grid system to enable responsive design on mobile and desktop devices. 
JavaScripts carousel feature has been used to provide an easy smooth approach to view images.
Bootstraps responsive embed feature has been used to showcase the bands music video.

## Testing

The site has been tested using the Chrome Developer Tools to confirm the site is responsive on multiple mobile devices extending to desktop versions.
Input data has been used to check the functionality of the modals. The site was also tested across multiple browsers to 
ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

## Deployment

The site has been deployed onto the GitHub platform. A new commit was pushed to the respository for each new seperate progressed
piece of functionality.
